Hi! This program was coded by eightkarots.

PyCrypt allows you to both encrypt and decrypt any file type of your choosing (Anything other than text files will not work with the display mode to decrypt).

When encrypting a file, you will be prompted to set a key which will be used later for decryption.
There are two modes for encryption, the no key mode (recommended) will not include a text file containing the key. The key mode (not recommended) will include one.

The display mode for decryption will display the decrypted contents of text files only.
The store mode for decryption will alter the contents of the original file back to its original unencrypted state.
